//! Request handler definitions
//!
//! Define each route and it handler here.
//! Handlers that are more than a line or two MUST go into a separate module. Keep this module neat and tidy 🙏
//!
//! A note about performance:
//! Since each worker thread processes its requests sequentially, handlers which block the current thread will cause the current worker to stop processing new requests:
//!
//!     fn my_handler() -> impl Responder {
//!         std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(5)); // <-- Bad practice! Will cause the current worker thread to hang!
//!         "response"
//!     }
//! For this reason, any long, non-cpu-bound operation (e.g. I/O, database operations, etc.) should be expressed as
//! futures or asynchronous functions. Async handlers get executed concurrently by worker threads and thus don’t block execution:
//!
//!     async fn my_handler() -> impl Responder {
//!         tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(5)).await; // <-- Ok. Worker thread will handle other requests here
//!         "response"
//!     }
